      "A website created and redesigned for Italian research and development company, AmbrosiaLab. Their primary focus is on cosmetics and food research, so the idea of using flowers and warm, natural colours came to me immediately.",
      "AmbrosiaLab's research is primarily on cosmetics and food. They also pride themselves on being a primarily female-staffed company. I wanted something feminine but with an emphasis of nature and beauty to it as well. So the idea of using flowers and peachy colours came to me.",
      "To give the site a fresh feeling, I created a vertical navigation bar on the right-hand side of the site (for desktop users) in lieu of a standard horizontal navigation bar.",
      "Because of their international reach and partners, I included localization via i18n. The site is available in English and Italian and there is the framework for including future languages as well"
